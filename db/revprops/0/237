SetNormal, SetSelect and SetPartiall all work now. Only the root directory must not be put in the list as an ALL_UNSELECTED directory because it will never be removed. SetPartial, SetNormal now both remove unselected directories. If dir state changes from partial->partial, or selected->normal or partial->normal the unselected children in the list are deleted.
