replaced mytreectrl::GetDrStatus with StatusList::DetermineDirectoryStatus which checks the first generation children on disk instead of in the tree. Necessary because items are deleted in the tree when collapsed. DetermineDirectoryStatus is only called when a file is marked in the list control or when parents are marked. In all other cases like selecting or unselecting a directory the status can be determined. The statuslist class also has a loadstatuslist function which must be throughly tested.
