changed the AddCurDirChildren in the list control to use GetStatus for a file and let the StatusList class make all decisions. AddCurDirChildren is now much simpler. Also fixed a bug in GetStatus. When a directory is not in the list it may have a selected parent or it may be unselected. Put this in the GetStatus for a file.
